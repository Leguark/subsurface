# subsurface

A Python package for subsurface science and engineering.

The goal of this project is to support other subsurface geoscience and 
engineering projects with a set of classes for common subsurface data entities, 
such as seismic and GPR datasets, log curves, and so on. The current plan is to 
 use `xarray` under the hood, with `pint` for units support and `cartopy` for CRS and map support.

It's early days, everything might change. Help us figure it out!

We are changing things. Help us figure it out!
